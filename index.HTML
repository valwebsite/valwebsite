My Hobby is Coding. The reason I like coding is because it is fun and I also become smart from it. In this world, everything works with technology. I also wanted to do something with technology because I am interested. Coding also develops my mind too. Even in the future, in schools, colleges, high schools, and etc, we will start learning coding. And I can be ready when we have coding in school too because I have already experienced it.</p>
